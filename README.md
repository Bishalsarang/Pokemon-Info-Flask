# Pokemon-Info-Flask-
The purpose of this repository is to understand working of Flask and features like routing, template as well as understand using database by creating Pokedox that allows CRUD operations.
For database, I have used SQlite. Instead of using raw SQL queries  I have choosen to use SQLAlchemy to understand ORM database model.
